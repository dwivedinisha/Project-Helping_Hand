               <i><em >When I was about to turn 40, I decided I needed to do something 
                that would really expand my horizons. My life was good, but something was 
                missing. A feeling of making a true contribution on this planet was lacking 
                deep down inside of me. The need to fill that void led me to Ghaziabad, India 
                to spend several weeks volunteering at a preschool. Working with the children proved 
                completely overwhelming, as did the chaotic culture of India. What truly got to me, 
                however, was seeing an injured and bloody dog lying in the temple where the school 
                was held, apparently left to die. It broke my heart to watch the dog suffer — and 
                to see how little the local people seemed to care about his condition. I was saddened by
                 the reactions, and felt helpless. Incredibly, my path crossed with a local man who knew 
                 someone who could help. Miraculously, my actions and concern sparked a change. Today, 
                 I am happy to report the dog, Tommy, is healthy and cared for by this very village.  
                 I knew I needed to do everything in my power to improve the lives of the street animals. 
                 I worked with locals who formed <u> Helping Hand Animal Rescue Trust </u> to raise awareness
                about the animals of Ghaziabad and fund local projects.” – Bella Joffer, Founder</i></em>
